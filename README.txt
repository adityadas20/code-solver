You can download this folder and run the script using 'node hackerrank.js' (before running the script, make sure you run npm install)
You'll also need to provide your login credentials in the 'info.js' file; this task is pretty simple; just provide your hackerrank login email and password, and you're good to go. (your credentials remain on your own pc, don't worry!)
